# Discord-Bot
This was my first attempt at creating a Discord Bot and was the first time I used an API. The Bot is created using Discord.py and there are several functions of the bot, it has an economy system which allows users to create a wallet and bank so they can buy and sell items, send money to one another and play games. A shop where users can buy and sell metaphorical item and add them to their collection and a slots which allows users to earn more money if the win. It also contains some other smaller features like a 'Rob' command where money can be stolen from users and a 'Beg' command where users can earn extra coins.  I used Repl.it as the IDE as it allows you to host the bot on a website so it is always active within the Discord server instead of the program having to be constantly open.
