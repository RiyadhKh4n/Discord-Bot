# Discord-Bot
This was my first attempt at creating a Discord Bot and was the first time I used an API. The Bot is created using Discord.py and there are several functions of the bot, it has an economy system which allows users to create a wallet and bank so they can buy and sell items, send money to one another and play games. A shop where users can buy and sell metaphorical items and add them to their collection and a slots which allows users to earn more money if the win. It also contains some other smaller features like a 'Rob' command where money can be stolen from users and a 'Beg' command where users can earn extra coins.  I used Repl.it as the IDE as it allows you to host the bot on a website so it is always active within the Discord server instead of the program having to be constantly open. As this was my first time creating a Discord bot I did have to use the internet to help me get started and understand how to create it as well as read the API Documentation of course. I watched several videos from FreeCodeCamp to gain a basic understanding and then watched several hours of other YouTube videos from several different creators to better my knowledge of Discord.py. I then bagan coding by using what I had watched previously and the basic inderstadning I had to build the bot, anytime I got stuck I would use StackOverflow and YouTube to help me. I would say 60% - 70% of the code is original and the rest was copied from other sources.
